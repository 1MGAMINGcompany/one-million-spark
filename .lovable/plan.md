# Add Ludo Skill Article to Help Center

## Overview
Add a new help article "Is Ludo a Game of Skill or Luck?" to the Help Center under the Skill Games section, following the exact same patterns as existing articles.

## Changes Required

### 1. `src/data/helpArticles.tsx` -- Add new article entry

Insert a new article object before the engineering article (index position 6, before `server-enforced-turn-timeouts...`) with:
- **slug**: `ludo-skill-or-luck-competitive-strategy`
- **title**: "Is Ludo a Game of Skill or Luck? The Strategy Behind Competitive Ludo"
- **metaDescription**: "Is Ludo really just luck? Discover why competitive Ludo is a skill-based strategy game involving probability, positioning, and tactical decisions."
- **keywords**: Ludo-related SEO terms
- **cardDescription**: Short summary for the card grid
- **content**: Full JSX article matching existing prose styling (headings use `text-2xl font-semibold text-primary/90`, paragraphs use `text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed`, lists use `list-disc list-inside`)

The article content will be converted from the provided markdown into styled JSX matching the existing article format, with emoji headings removed and replaced with clean text headings. Related links at the bottom will point to the existing skill games articles.

### 2. `src/pages/HelpCenter.tsx` -- Register slug in Skill Games section

Add `"ludo-skill-or-luck-competitive-strategy"` to the `skillSlugs` array (line 20) so it appears in the "Skill Games" grid on the Help Center landing page.

### 3. `src/components/seo/RelatedArticles.tsx` -- Add category mapping

Add `"ludo-skill-or-luck-competitive-strategy": "skill"` to the `categoryMap` object so the related articles algorithm correctly categorizes it.

## No Other Changes Needed
- Routing already handled by the existing `/help/:slug` dynamic route
- JSON-LD structured data automatically generated by `HelpArticle.tsx`
- Breadcrumbs automatically generated
- CTA and related articles sections automatically rendered
- No database or backend changes
